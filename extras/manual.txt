shell.py
    shell basically forms the structure of the interpreter
    shell takes the input from the user
    prints the output or the error

basic.py
    contains classes :
    Token,
    Lexer,
    Error,
    Parser,
    Interpreter
    BinaryOpNode,
    UnaryOpNode,
    NumberNode,
    ParseResult,
    RTResult,
    Number,
    Context,
    IllegalCharError,
    InvalidSyntaxError,
    RTError.,
    Position

    run method
        Run is responsible for Invoking Lexer, Parser and Interpreter.
        It invokes them to perform lexical analysis, syntax analysis and Interpretation.
        Also while doing so, if an error is encountered, It is responsible for returning the error.

    lexer class:
        make_token is a function of lexer class which creates individual token and appends it in the token list.
        Also if it identifies character it creates error and routes it to IllegalCharError class.
        make_token returns two value tokens and error.




    position class:
        defines the position of individual token that we are defining and indicate the position of the error
        each class contains his own position class object.

    IllegalCharError class:
        It inherits error class.
        It calls error function using super.
        So basically it conducts error handling.

    token class:
        It takes token type,value and representation for the token object.

    parser class:
        It accepts tokens in the sequential and creates the syntax tree.

    parse method:
        It creates abstract syntax tree for the particular expression.
        It calls expr
        Refer grammar.txt

    expr method:
        It calls term.

    term method:
        It calls factor.

    factor method:
        It creates the object ParseResult.

        ParseResult Class:
